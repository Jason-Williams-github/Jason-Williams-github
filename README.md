## About Me
I am a dedicated full stack engineer who loves to learn. I am proficient in both front end and backend frameworks as well as working with databases.

## Projects

### Nile
* Our team developed a mock Amazon that was fully functional and deployed. Everyone was assigned different components and ensuring that they all functioned properly. I was in charge of the review component. This component would show all reviews for their associated product, as well as the ability to create new reviews. Users were also able to rate any features that the product had.
  * JavaScript
  * React/HTML/CSS
  * PostgreSQL
  * JPA/Hibernate
  * AWS

### Find My Paradise
* As a team we created a deployed a mock AirBnB. Everyone was assigned components for the project and were tasked with making the front and backend of these components. I was in charge of the host component which gathered information from an associated listing object and populated the page with the correct information.
  * JavaScript
  * Vue/HTML/CSS
  * MySQL
  * JPA/Hibernate
  * AWS

#### Firearm Museum
* I created a database of firearms that would allow interested users to easily learn about any firearm that was present in the database. I had all of the Firearm objects broken down into smaller components that allowed me to give more information about each component in more detail as well as add new firearms to the database in a modular way.
  * Typescript
  * Angular/HTML/CSS
  * Postgres/JDBC
  * Springboot
  * Maven

### Citi Bike vs. Divvy Bike dataset
* I worked with Citi Bike's and Divvy's publicly available dataset to compare and contrast the two. I focused on demographics such as age and gender to see which of the two companies would be a better fit in the downtown Atlanta area. To help with my points I used some of Python's available data analytical tools such as Pandas to view and clean the data and Altair for visualization.
  * Python 3
  * Pandas
  * Altair

## Experience

#### Talent Path (Full-Stack Engineer. December 2020 - December 2021 )

* Full stack engineer at Talent Path where we would be assigned to do contracting work for external companies. While not off on an assignment we would be constantly learning new skills in different languages or architecture as well as upskilling our already existing skills.
* Worked on solo projects as well as team based ones using Zoom and Git as the main forms of communication and cooperation.
